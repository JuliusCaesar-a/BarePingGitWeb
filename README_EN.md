# BarePingWidget

> An Android home-screen widget and app that monitors whether sites like GitHub are **reachable without a proxy (bare connection)**, showing green / yellow / red status with latency, and popping a banner alert when connectivity is restored.
>
> The same feature set ships in **three implementations**: native Android, Flutter, and a pure-web single file.

---

## Project Name & Introduction

**BarePingWidget** is a lightweight connectivity monitor. It probes target hosts through a direct, proxy-bypassing connection and maps reachability into three colored states — green (fast & reachable), yellow (reachable but slow), and red (unreachable) — then surfaces that state on a home-screen widget and via notifications. It is built for anyone who needs to keep an eye on whether GitHub and related domains are directly accessible at a glance.

## Three Implementations

| Implementation | Directory | Form | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Native Android** | [`app/`](app/) | APK | Kotlin, the most complete; includes WorkManager background monitoring and three widget sizes |
| **Flutter** | [`flutter_app/`](flutter_app/) | APK | Dart, UI matches the native build; **no** WorkManager background monitoring (widgets are still served by the native provider) |
| **Pure web** | [`html/index.html`](html/index.html) | Single HTML file | Zero deps, zero build — just open it in a browser, or host it as a static page |

All three share the same thresholds and storage keys, so behavior is consistent:

- Each probe takes 3 samples and averages them: **green < 500 ms**, **yellow < 3000 ms**, **red = unreachable**, unknown = not probed yet
- Foreground auto-refresh every 30 seconds; stops when you leave the screen to save power
- A site flipping **red → green** triggers exactly one alert (multiple recoveries merged into a single notification)

## Features

- [x] **Home-screen widgets**: three sizes — 2×2, 4×3, and 1×2 — pin to your launcher for an at-a-glance status
- [x] **Bare-connection detection**: green (< 500 ms) / yellow (< 3000 ms) / red (unreachable) / unknown, color-coded
- [x] **Background periodic monitoring**: WorkManager runs every 15 minutes, gated by "network connected + battery not low" for battery efficiency
- [x] **Recovery banner**: a one-time heads-up notification when any site flips from red → green (multiple recoveries merged into one)
- [x] **Custom monitored sites**: add or remove hosts from Settings; six GitHub-related domains ship by default
- [x] **Light / Dark / System theme**: cycle with one tap on the main screen
- [x] **30-second foreground auto-refresh**: a countdown progress bar at the bottom; stops when you leave the screen to save power
- [x] **Cached state & low traffic**: only reads response headers (`Range: bytes=0-0`), under 10 KB per round; renders last cached result on cold start

## 1. Native Android

### Requirements

- **JDK**: 11 (compiled with `jvmTarget = JVM_11`; Gradle 9.x resolves the toolchain automatically)
- **Android SDK**: `compileSdk = 37`, `minSdk = 24` (runs on Android 7.0+)
- **IDE**: Android Studio (Hedgehog or newer) recommended
- **Build tool**: Gradle 9.5.0 (pinned by the project's Wrapper — no manual install needed)

### Clone & build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/10086ggqq/BarePingwidget.git
cd BarePingwidget

./gradlew build          # Linux / macOS
gradlew.bat build        # Windows

./gradlew assembleDebug  # Output: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
./gradlew installDebug   # Install & launch on a connected device / emulator
```

On first open, make sure `local.properties` points at your SDK (this file is git-ignored and never committed):

```properties
# local.properties
sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/Sdk
```

After installing, long-press your home screen → **Widgets** → choose **BarePingWidget 2×2 / 4×3 / 1×2**.

To change the default monitored sites, edit `defaultSites()` in `app/src/main/java/com/example/barepingwidget/data/SiteRepository.kt`, or simply add/remove them in-app under **Settings → Monitored sites**.

---

## 2. Flutter

### Requirements

- Flutter SDK (Dart `^3.13.1`)
- JDK 17 (`jvmTarget = JVM_17`)
- Android SDK

### Build

```bash
cd flutter_app
flutter pub get

flutter run                                        # Debug run
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi        # Per-ABI release (recommended)
```

> Prefer `--split-per-abi`: arm64 and armeabi-v7a each get their own APK (~17 MB / ~15 MB) instead of a fat APK stacking up to ~50 MB.

### Release signing

Signing credentials are **not** committed. Create `flutter_app/android/key.properties` (git-ignored):

```properties
storeFile=bareping.jks
storePassword=your_password
keyAlias=bareping
keyPassword=your_password
```

- `storeFile` resolves relative to `android/app/`, or use an absolute path;
- Without `key.properties` the build script falls back to debug signing so a fresh clone still builds (local verification only — do not distribute).

### Differences from the native build

- **No** WorkManager background monitoring (foreground polling with stop-on-leave matches the native experience closely enough)
- Home-screen widgets are still provided by `flutter_app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/.../PingWidgetProvider.kt`, reading sites and status from the Flutter-side `SharedPreferences` (`flutter.` prefix)

---

## 3. Pure Web

Open `html/index.html` in any browser — no dependencies, no build step.

- Single self-contained file; drop it into Wallpaper Engine / Lively Wallpaper, or deploy to any static host
- Sites and state live in `localStorage`, matching the app's behavior
- See `html/preview-light.png`, `html/preview-dark.png`, and `html/preview-settings.png` for previews

## Known Behavior

- Only **HTTP 200–399** counts as reachable, so a site returning 404 (some default domains do) shows red — that is intentional, to separate "responds" from "blocked".
- Some OEM ROMs aggressively throttle background work, so the WorkManager interval may stretch beyond 15 minutes in practice.

Issues and Pull Requests are welcome!

### Filing an Issue

Please use a clear title and include the following so we can triage quickly:

- **Environment**: Android version, app version (`versionName = 1.0`), device model, and which implementation (native / Flutter / web)
- **Expected / Actual**: what you expected vs. what you observed
- **Steps to reproduce**: a stable sequence of actions
- **Logs**: if relevant, attach `logcat` lines filtered by `com.example.barepingwidget`

### Pull Request workflow

1. Fork the repo and clone it locally
2. Branch off `main`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Keep the code style consistent (official Kotlin style; `kotlin.code.style=official` is set)
4. Make sure `./gradlew build` passes; add tests where it makes sense
5. Write concise commit messages (Chinese or English); push and open a PR
6. In the PR description, explain the intent, impact, and attach screenshots if UI is involved

> ⚠️ Signing files (`*.jks` / `*.keystore`), `key.properties`, and `local.properties` are excluded via `.gitignore` — please **never** commit secrets or machine-specific paths.
